- Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
  * Despite the NSA's efforts, Tor's anonymity remains largely intact, with occasional compromises mainly due to browser exploits.
  * TOR is not entirely for criminals; Also, it's used by activists, the military, families, and journalists, and helps protect against various cyber threats, similar to the broader internet's use.
  * TOR was created and funded by US Navy, but it does not have any backdoor. Moreover, it is audited by some experts in cryptographers and security professionals who ensure it.
  * TOR is used for secure communications, activists for anonymity and censorship, and militaries.
  * Tails are used to route Internet connection through Tor.
  * Running a Tor relay is generally legal, but engaging in criminal activities through Tor can attract law enforcement attention and harm the platform's reputation.
  * TOR is a robust anonymity tool, dispelling misconceptions and offering strong privacy protection, making it a valuable choice for online privacy.
 
- Shavers & Bair 2016
  * Introduction
     - Overview of the Tor Browser
     - Emphasizing its role in safeguarding online anonymity and privacy.
     - Easy to use, simple, free.

  * History and Intended Use of The Onion Router
     - Tor is intended for anonymous communication.
     - Tor allows anybody to communicate through the internet anonymously by hiding the user's ip address.
     - Tor works by routing traffic through relays and firstly data layed using elliptic curve cryptography, which is currently unbreakable with brute force.
     - It is currently an open-source project, allowing anyone with knowledge to improve it.
       
  * How The Onion Router Works
     - Tor uses relays between sender and receiver.
     - Elliptic curve cryptography - unbreakable with current resources.
     - Step-by-step process through which Tor anonymizes data, impossible to trace back to its source.
     - The core concept of "onion routing," elucidates how data is layered with multiple encryption levels for enhanced anonymity.
     - Volunteer-Operated Servers- played by a network of volunteer-operated servers in routing and anonymizing data traffic.

  * Tracking Criminals Using TOR
     - Efforts to track Tor users face considerable challenges, and while some successes have occurred, they often result from user errors rather than breaking Tor itself.
     - Governments worldwide aim to deanonymize Tor for various reasons, but notable successes often stem from exploiting user mistakes.
     - The FBI once targeted a child pornography hosting service via a Firefox exploit, compromising Tor users' true IP addresses temporarily.
     - Tor's strength lies in its default security settings. Customizations can inadvertently leak information.
     - Investigators seek to obtain a user's true IP address to facilitate conventional investigative methods.
     - Another tactic involves sending a document with a tracking code that captures the IP address when opened.
    -  Ross Ulbricht
       - Ross Ulbricht's use of his real name and personal email for a Bitcoin project on the open Internet significantly contributed to his identification as the Silk Road operator and eventual life sentence (Bradbury, 2013).
    - Harvard student Eldo Kim
       - Kim's use of Tor was exposed when Harvard's IT staff detected his access during the exam, leading to his confession when questioned by the FBI (Dalton, 2013).
    
### Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). 

When I started by downloading TOR to my mac laptop from TOR project. I also selected English as language

Here we can see Tor browser can be installed on various operating systems. For this exercise, we will go for the macOS executable.

And that's it! It's a straightforward process with no coding, no confusing steps, and no complications.

## TOR sites

### Search Engine

Here are some search engines for the Tor network:

* DuckDuckGo: It's a privacy-focused search engine with an onion address for Tor users. You can use it at "https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/".

* NotEvil: Another search engine for Tor, accessible at "http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion/".

* Candle: A deep web search engine that indexes .onion sites, available at "http://gjobqjj7wyczbqie.onion/".

* Onion.link: This service lets you access regular websites through Tor, and you can find it at "http://onion.link/".

To search for onion sites, you can use search engines like "DuckDuckGo" or "NotEvil" specifically designed for the dark web. Simply enter your query, and these search engines will return results from onion sites.

### Marketplace

There are marketplaces on the Tor network, but please note that accessing and using such marketplaces can involve legal and security risks. Here is an example:

* The Green Machine Marketplace: This is a forum-type marketplace that may have listings for various products. However, it's important to exercise caution when dealing with any marketplace on the Tor network, as they may not always be reliable, and some could be potentially illegal. It appeared to have been inactive for approximately 70 days.

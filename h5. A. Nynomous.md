- Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
  * Despite the NSA's efforts, Tor's anonymity remains largely intact, with occasional compromises mainly due to browser exploits.
  * TOR is not entirely for criminals; Also, it's used by activists, the military, families, and journalists, and helps protect against various cyber threats, similar to the broader internet's use.
  * TOR was created and funded by US Navy, but it does not have any backdoor. Moreover, it is audited by some experts in cryptographers and security professionals who ensure it.
  * TOR is used for secure communications, activists for anonymity and censorship, and militaries.
  * Tails are used to route Internet connection through Tor.
  * Running a Tor relay is generally legal, but engaging in criminal activities through Tor can attract law enforcement attention and harm the platform's reputation.
  * TOR is a robust anonymity tool, dispelling misconceptions and offering strong privacy protection, making it a valuable choice for online privacy.
 
- Shavers & Bair 2016
  * Introduction
     - Overview of the Tor Browser
     - Emphasizing its role in safeguarding online anonymity and privacy.
     - Easy to use, simple, free.

  * History and Intended Use of The Onion Router
     - Tor is intended for anonymous communication.
     - Tor allows anybody to communicate through the internet anonymously by hiding the user's ip address.
     - Tor works by routing traffic through relays and firstly data layed using elliptic curve cryptography, which is currently unbreakable with brute force.
     - It is currently an open-source project, allowing anyone with knowledge to improve it.
       
  * How The Onion Router Works
     - Tor uses relays between sender and receiver.
     - Elliptic curve cryptography - unbreakable with current resources.
     - Step-by-step process through which Tor anonymizes data, impossible to trace back to its source.
     - The core concept of "onion routing," elucidates how data is layered with multiple encryption levels for enhanced anonymity.
     - Volunteer-Operated Servers- played by a network of volunteer-operated servers in routing and anonymizing data traffic.

  * Tracking Criminals Using TOR
     - Efforts to track Tor users face considerable challenges, and while some successes have occurred, they often result from user errors rather than breaking Tor itself.
     - Governments worldwide aim to deanonymize Tor for various reasons, but notable successes often stem from exploiting user mistakes.
     - The FBI once targeted a child pornography hosting service via a Firefox exploit, compromising Tor users' true IP addresses temporarily.
     - Tor's strength lies in its default security settings. Customizations can inadvertently leak information.
     - Investigators seek to obtain a user's true IP address to facilitate conventional investigative methods.
     - Another tactic involves sending a document with a tracking code that captures the IP address when opened.
    -  Ross Ulbricht
       - Ross Ulbricht's use of his real name and personal email for a Bitcoin project on the open Internet significantly contributed to his identification as the Silk Road operator and eventual life sentence (Bradbury, 2013).
    - Harvard student Eldo Kim
       - Kim's use of Tor was exposed when Harvard's IT staff detected his access during the exam, leading to his confession when questioned by the FBI (Dalton, 2013).

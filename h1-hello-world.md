## Mercenary 
A mercenary can be defined in two main ways: as a soldier employed by one army to work for another, and as an individual who works primarily for monetary gain. Mercenaries lack strong allegiances beyond their employers and are hired to complete tasks without questioning. Despite this, mercenaries are complex beings with emotions and hidden loyalties. If asked to perform actions conflicting with their internal moral boundaries, conflicts arise and their sense of allegiance becomes strained, potentially leading to failure.

## 1. Mercenary hackers inside UAE Project Raven
WASHINGTON- It starts following an American mercenary hacking on behalf of the UAE government, under the guise of aiding the fight against terrorism. That's a pretty gnarly start but it gets wild. Two weeks after leaving her position as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. National Security Agency in 2014, Lori Stroud was in the Middle East working as a hacker for an Arab monarchy and had joined Project Raven.

After 3 years; Emiratis moved Project Raven to a UAE cybersecurity firm named DarkMatter. Later where she and other Americans where involved and efforts to say the mission had crossed the red line.   

she mentioned "“I am working for a foreign intelligence agency who is targeting U.S. persons,” she told Reuters. “I am officially the bad kind of spy.”


The Raven story also provides new insight into the role former American cyberspies play in foreign hacking operations. Within the U.S. intelligence community, leaving to work as an operative for another country is seen by some as a betrayal. “There’s a moral obligation if you’re a former intelligence officer from becoming effectively a mercenary for a foreign government,” said Bob Anderson, who served as executive assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 2015.

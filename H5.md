### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions

* One-way functions in the context of cryptography.
  - One-way functions are mathematical functions that are relatively easy to compute in one direction but infeasible to reverse. In other words, they are easy forward side but extremely difficult to compute when it comes to the backward.

- Schneier explores how one-way functions are used in cryptographic algorithms to securely hash passwords, create digital signatures, and ensure data integrity. He also discusses about "trapdoor one-way function," which introduces a secret key that allows for the efficient computation of the inverse function.

- Understanding one-way functions is crucial, as it forms the basis for many security protocols and cryptographic techniques that protect sensitive data and communications.

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.4 One-Way Hash Function

* One-way hash functions take an input and produce a fixed-size output (hash value) that is unique to that input.
* Easy to compute in one direction (from input to hash value)
* One-way hash functions are vital for password storage (hashing passwords) and data integrity verification.
* Message Authentication Code (MAC) / Data Authentication Code (DAC)
    * One-way hash function with a secret key.
    * Hash value is determined by the pre-image as well as the key.

- Overall One-way hash functions are a cornerstone of modern cryptography, offering a crucial layer of security for various applications.

### Särökaari 2018: Phishing through email

- Niklas Särökaari's presentation on phishing through email highlighted the strategies and techniques cyber attackers employ to deceive individuals and organizations.
- Why people fall for phishing scams (based on a study by BlackaHat 2016 with 1200 participants):
   * 34% curiosity.
   * 27% participants expected a similar email to come already and assumed it to be authentic.
   * 16% assumed sender was authentic.
- The primary goal of phishing is to manipulate recipients into taking actions that benefit the attacker, such as clicking on malicious links, downloading harmful attachments, or divulging sensitive information like passwords.
- He highlighted the factors that make phishing effective, such as using familiar sender names, urgent messages, and relevant topics.
- Niklas emphasized the importance of implementing email authentication mechanisms like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to protect against email spoofing.
  - Domain Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC):
     * Uses SPF and DKIM records and provides reports if someone is trying to abuse the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
     * Using SPF and DKIM provides legitimacy to your domain.
     * Using SPF and DKIM a phisher can bypass email protection filters.
- Summary of mitigation:
   * Using SPF, DKIM, DMARC
   * Safe domains
   * Educating employees on phishing
   * He also stressed that phishing remains a significant threat, with attackers continuously finding new ways to exploit human behavior and vulnerabilities.

### Hashcat Installation

The Debian 12 virtual environment is run on a Windows 10 version 10.0 build 19045 system. Below are some specs on the virtual environment:

As I have MAC I have tried to install and process but it did not work. Through I have see in the class and worked with another classmate. 

Here is a step-by-step process for installing Hashcat on a Linux system:

Open a Terminal: To begin the installation process, open a terminal window on your Linux system.

Update System Packages: It's always a good practice to ensure your system's package repositories are up-to-date. Run the following command to update your system's package list:

sudo apt update 
- sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
If you're using a different Linux distribution, replace apt with the appropriate package manager for your system.

Install Hashcat Dependencies: Hashcat requires certain libraries and dependencies to work correctly. Install them using the package manager. On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, Second, a new directory for our hashcat stuff.

hashcat --version
This command should display the version of Hashcat that has been installed.

Download Hashcat Rules and Wordlists: Depending on your specific use case, you may need to download additional rules or wordlists to use with Hashcat. You can find various wordlists and rules on the Hashcat website or other online sources.
- Third, we need a dictionary that hashcat can use to find hashes. For this we download Rockyou. https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Usage: Hashcat can be used for various purposes, including password cracking and recovery. You can run Hashcat with the appropriate command and options, specifying the hash or password file you want to crack, the attack mode, and the rules or wordlists to use.

We need to remember that Hashcat should only be used for legitimate and ethical purposes, For instance, if you forgot your password and want to recover your forgotten passwords or just test the security of your systems. Because It is illegal if you are using it and it is unauthorized, So, always need to follow the guidelines provided under the law when using such password-cracking tools.

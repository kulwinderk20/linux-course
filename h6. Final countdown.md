### Firewall

First, As I have MAC it has an inbuilt firewall, 
* macOS includes a built-in firewall to protect the Mac from network access and denial-of-service attacks. It can be configured in the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences and supports the following configurations:
- Block all incoming connections, regardless of app.

- I did this task with another classmate while he was doing his task, 

wherein, opened the terminal and update thing:
After updating, upgrading, and rebooting, Install firewall, with command
 - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install ufw
Start UFW and enable it to run at system boot:
  - sudo ufw enable
By default, UFW allows all outgoing traffic and denies incoming traffic.
  - sudo ufw default deny incoming
  - sudo ufw default allow outgoing
Allow Specific Ports:
  - Alternatively, rather than [sudo ufw allow ssh] we can use [sudo ufw allow 22/tcp].

### Ssherver. Install OpenSSH server and connect to it.

So lets use OpenSSH, first by installing SSH
- Install the OpenSSH Server on macOS
  Terminal app on Mac and "Utilities" folder.

To install the OpenSSH server, run the following command:
- sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
- Prompt message to enter your administrator password.

But after entering the password it does not proceed further and getting error

Later, complete the task with another classmate

Tried to connect to Tero's server. Unfortunately, without a password could not connect it.

Then, we just connected and created a user on his localhost.

- whoami: Displays the username of the current user.
- sudo adduser NAME: Creates a new user on the Linux system.
- ssh-keygen: Generates an SSH key pair for tasks like authentication and automatic login.
- ssh-copy-id NAME@localhost: Establishes a connection with the specified host and uploads the user's SSH key for authentication.

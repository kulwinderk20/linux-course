        € Costa-Gazcón 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting. Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary 
        (all but "Testing yourself", which is left as voluntary bonus)
 
 1. The MITRE ATT&CK framework
 
  Description of 14 TTPs (tactics, techniques (+subtechniques), procedures) according to MITRE ATT&CK framwework.
  Each tactic has its own set of techniques/subtechniques with specific TA behaviors. 
   1. Reconnaissance  - new - trying to get as much info about the victim as possible 
   2. Resources Dev - new - conducting assessing resources process (these resources can be purchased, stolen, or developed)
   3. Initial Access - the very first step to get into victim's environment and get a foothold in the network using entry vectors
   4. Execution - using mali code inside victim's environment 
   5. Persistence - trying to stay inside victim' system 
   6. Privilige Escalation - trying to upgragde their access level, privilige, permission
   7. Defense Evation - avoiding to be detected by the victim's defense 
   8. Credential access - taking/ stealing user's credetial access to gain access fruther into the system, or to disguise their malicious activities 
   9. Discovery - gaining knowledge on how victim's environment is built
   10. Lateral movement - discovering how victim's network and system are configured, then pivoting from 1 to another until getting the target 
   11. Collection - collecting info from victim's environment for further exfiltration
   12. Command & Control - communication with the system after control it
   13. Exfiltration - stealing info why trying to stay undetected
   14. Impact - preventing users from accessing the system (manipulating/destroying the system and on)
 
 Procedure is the specific way a TA implements a specific techniques or subtechniques. A procedure can cover multiple techniques and subtechniques as well. 
 
 The ATT&CK Matrix 
 
Introduction to MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise with tactics and theirs specific techniques related with expansion to techniques specifications (ID,     procedure examples, mitigation, detection and on) making ATT&CK a great resource for training, studying, planning and mapping. (Term used here - _"planning blue and red teaming exercises"_ a training strategy where the "red team" is the one trying to attack (TA) and the "blue team" is the one trying to defend.

  The ATT&CK Navigator 
 
  Brief introduction to use the ATT&CK navigator which is a great studying tool to visualize a TA ' modus operandi ("a method of procedure"), or generate a security exercise. I found the introduction too brief, and took use of [Comparing layers in ATT&CK Navigator Walkthrough](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/training-cti/Comparing%20Layers%20in%20Navigator.pdf) which provided a much comprehensive instruction. 
 
 2. Mapping with ATT&CK
 
  Example of identifying ATT&CK tactics used in the case of Virus Bulletin 2018: Inside Formbook Infostealer by the malware researcher Gabriela Nicolao: (https://www.virusbulletin.com/uploads/pdf/magazine/2018/VB2018-Nicolao.pdf)

  Answer in the context of Mitre Att&ck, and pick examples that are different from the chapter in task x.
  
   * Define tactic and give an example.

The one I picked here is Execution (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/). As briefly mentioned in the previous part, execution refers to the act of TA running malicious code inside the victim's environment, either local or remote. This is usually paired with other tactics' techniques to acchieve broader goals, like getting data or "getting to know" the network, system. 
  
   * Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each.

There are 13 techniques included in this tactic and 21 subtechniques, of those, I focus here on T1204. User Execution and its subtechniques (malicious emails, links and/or images). User Execution usually goes in pair with other techniques, among them, most often, Phishing from Initial Access or may also occur at later phases of an instrution, for example, Command and Control via Remote Access Software. Using this tactic, TA "tricks" (social engineers) the victims into conducting specific actions to gain excecution. Few examples: 
  
   * user executing malicious code by opening a malicious document file, or links - in my opinion, this is one of most common/frequent form of techniques used. The TA (phisher/scammer) would send a "fake" email (looking like a legit one) containing a link/file asking for action from the user/victim. The user then clicks on the link or open the file attached which triggers downloading some malware without the user's knowledge and this later exploits and infect user' system. Example: [zdnet article -   hackers sending email with pdf file containing embedded word document triggering Snake keyloggermalware dowload to steal information](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-malware-spreading-pdf-uses-a-sneaky-file-name-to-trick-the-unwary/)
 
   * user opening a file in a shared directory placed by the TA 
   * user enabling Remote Access Software, letting TA have direct control of the system.
  
  
   * Define procedure, and give an example of each - TBC 
  
TA sending Windows' users email containing malicious PDF files named "REMMITANCE INVOICE.pdf" with an embedded Word document named "has been verified. However PDF, Jpeg, xlsx, .docs". 
  
Once opening the file, Adobe Reader prompts the user to open the Word file, and here because of the name conbined with the warning notification from Adobe Reader, it reads "The file 'has been verified. However PDF, Jpeg, xlsx, .docs' may contain programs, macros or viruses that could potentially harm your computer. Open the file only if you are sure it is safe. Would you like to:" 
  
At the first glance, the notification with combination of the file name looks normal (the file's has been verified...).

The Word document contains a malicious URL where an external object linking and embedding (OLE) object. 
  
If the protected view is disable, Word would then download a Rich Text Format file from a web server which would be run in the context of the open document.
  
The OLE object contains shellcode exploiting the [CVE-2017-11882](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2017-11882) remote code execution vulnerability in Equation Editor which had been addressed in 2017. 
  
It would also download the Snake Keylogger a malware used to steal sensitive information from user’s device, including saved credentials, keystrokes, screenshots of the user’s screen, and clipboard data. 

Other techniques which may have been used based on the context provided in the articles could be: 

  * Reconnaissance: Gather victim Identity Information -> T1589.002 	Email Addresses 
  * Initial Access: Phishing -> T1566.001 Spearphishing Attachment

        Insecure Login: 2 Let's try
  
Quite straight-forward task using knowledge from the previous 'General - Developer Tools' in h1, I used "Inspect" - "Network"- Click on "Log in" button - Find the "Post" start.mvc query - Click on "Request" to find the login details. 

The only issue I got in here is that password was given on the first line and username on the second line, so in a pilot mode, I tried the combo "password-username" and well, it didn't work. I started digging the internet and found out the tutorial/walkthrough showed the steps I done, with only the difference in the name of "username". 
  
Ahah, so, lesson learnt: pay attention to each and every single thing, no matter how minor/silly they may look.

  "Testing yourself" in Costa-Gazcón: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting
  Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary
 The very first techniques I was able to identify was User Execution: Malicious File (ID: T1204.002) and Malicious Link (ID: T1204.001) focusing on _"Formbook […] was distributed via PDFs with embedded links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and compressed files containing the executable"_

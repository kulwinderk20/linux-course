Restricted algorithm:
    *	The algorithm is secret and unknown.
    *	No quality control or standardization.
    *	Popular for low-sec applications.
*	Key:
    *	All possible values of key are in keyspace.
    *	Security of algorithms that use keys are based in the key.
*	Symmetric algorithm:
    *	Both sender and receiver have the same key.
*	Asymmetric algorithm:
    *	Sender has public key, receiver has private key.
    *	One-way communication.
